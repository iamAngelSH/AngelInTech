    "You should check for the FizzBuzz condition first, as it checks for multiple conditions. For example, the number 15 is divisible with both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz should get printed. 15 is also divisible by 3 and 5 individually, and we donâ€™t want Fizz or Buzz printed alone."

    "A factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from that number to 1. For example, the factorial of 5, or 5! is $5*4*3*2*1 = 120$. Factorials are not defined for negative numbers and the factorial of zero is one.\n",

    "    - *return* **n** *in any other case.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You should check for the FizzBuzz condition first, as it checks for multiple conditions. For example, the number 15 is divisible with both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz should get printed. 15 is also divisible by 3 and 5 individually, and we donâ€™t want Fizz or Buzz printed alone."

Hi Techies üëã

Welcome to the the Random Password Generator tutorial. 

Here you will find 3 files that are available to download.
- Python file to execute in a python environment.
- Python notebook where YOU can implement RPG from scratch.
- Python notebook that contains the solution to my implementation of RPG.

I have also provided a MyBinder where you can interact with the notebooks right from your browser.
- Here is the link to MyBinder:

    - Once you are in this JupyterLab, navigate to the folder called `Random_Password_Generator`.
      - In this folder you can interact with the notebooks straight from your browser.

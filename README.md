Hello Python Enthusiasts üëã

In this repo I have included project tutorials, python snippets, python interview Qs, and other python related things.

I hope you have fun and learn! If you would like to contribute:

- Send me a DM on [twitter](https://twitter.com/iamAngelSH) with your contribution.

I have also included a MyBinder that you can access to interact with the content on this repo. 
-   - [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iamAngelSH/AngelInTech/HEAD)
    - Once you are in this JupyterLab, you will be able to navigate to other directories in this repository.

My goal here is to encourage you to build upon these projects and improve them for your own learning or fun!
